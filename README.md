# CARLA-TWIN
This framework is built upon the open-source CARLA simulator. To reproduce this environment, CARLA must first be installed on a local server. While pre-compiled versions are available at carla.org, we recommend building CARLA from source to ensure full compatibility and access to customizable features, as detailed in https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_carla/.
